## Big Band Athens
<p><strong>Big Band Athens</strong> is an 18-member band formed in the summer of 2006, and is under the direction of Ben Robinson. It schedules independently of the Classic City Band. Our mission continues to be to make the music of the ’40s Big Band Era available for local retirement homes, senior citizen groups, and select non-profit fundraising benefits. We include some ’50s and ’60s arrangements for additional variety in our program at various other venues.</p>
<p>We have been honored to play for several venues in the Athens area, including Athens Jazz Festival, Athens Area Homeless Shelter (Harvest For The Homeless), YWCO, Athens Area Home Builders Association, The Lyndon House, Morton Theater, Boy’s and Girl’s Clubs, Rotary Club of Athens, Oconee County 4th of July Celebration, and Georgia State Botanical Garden of Athens, to name a few.</p>
<p>Big Band Athens is available for weddings, dance clubs, banquets, and other private events.</p>
<p>The donation required is set depending on the length of the program and the location of the venue. Please contact <a href="mailto:benrobi71@gmail.com">Ben Robinson</a> at 770-366-8428 for scheduling and more details.</p>
