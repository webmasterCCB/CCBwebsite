## Help Send Classic City Band to Carnegie Hall!

(Yes, <i>that</i> Carnegie Hall, on Manhattan!)

### Our Historic Opportunity

2026 is not only the Classic City Band's 50th anniversary (longest continuously-operating community band in Georgia history!), but also the year we are going to perform in the fantastic <strong>Carnegie Hall</strong> in New York City!

### What Your Donation Supports

This trip is an amazing, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for most of the band, but it is also expensive. The band still needs about $25,000 to cover all the costs - that is the costs that aren't being paid by the band members themselves. We are paying because this is a fantastic opportunity not only for us, but to put Athens-Clarke County on the marquee. 

### Fundraising Goal

**Goal:** $25,000
