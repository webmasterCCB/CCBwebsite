<h2>Kroger Community Rewards Program</h2>

<p>Support Classic City Band at no cost to you! Every time you shop at Kroger using your rewards card, a percentage of your purchase will be donated to CCB. If you don't have a rewards card, but you do shop at Kroger, you can register for one at one of their stores. You'll also need a login for <a href="https://www.kroger.com" target="_blank">kroger.com</a>. By signing up, you'll have ways to save while shopping at Kroger, plus you can take less than 5 minutes to have Kroger <strong>pay us</strong> every time you shop! Find out more at <a href="https://www.kroger.com/i/community/community-rewards" target="_blank">Kroger's Community Rewards site</a></p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Re-enroll every year (typically April 1st) to continue supporting CCB.</p>
